<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I am currently completing my 3rd year of an Electrical & Biomedical Engineering degree, where I have analyzed and processed telecommunication signals, learned the inner mechanisms of medical technologies such as MRIs, and completed courses in Electrical Circuits, Control Systems, Microprocessor Systems, and Signal Processing. My work experience in pharmacy provided me with strong customer service and communication skills, and academic experiences helped me develop technical skills in AutoDesk Inventor and SPICE. My computer skills also include excellent knowledge of Microsoft Office, and signal processing methods using MatLab.</p>
